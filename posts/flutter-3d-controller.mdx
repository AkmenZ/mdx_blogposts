In this tutorial we will create a simple product page, but we will use a 3D object. To do it we will utilize `flutter_3d_controller` package.

This is a versatile 3D rendering package, that also allows to control animations. The goal is to create an interactive page, where the object slowly spins arround, but the user can hold it and rotate it as they please.

Here's a preview of how the complete page will look.

Pretty cool right? So lets begin by adding the package. In my case, I'm using version `1.3.1`.

You can paste it in `pubspec.yaml` file manually, or using a command:

```bash
flutter pub add flutter_3d_controller
```

And here is the full code for creating such a page. Off course design it how ever you please.
