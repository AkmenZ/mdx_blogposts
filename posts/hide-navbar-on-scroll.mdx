This is a quick tutorial on how to hide the navbar when scrolling down, and make it reappear when scrolling back up.

This effect is used here in this blog site, so you can see it in action.

To atcheive it, we will be using Framer Motion package, so go ahead and install it.

```
npm install framer-motion
```

Next, import it in your Navbar component. We will also use **useScroll** and **useMotionValueEvent** hooks.

```
import { motion, useScroll, useMotionValueEvent } from "framer-motion";
```

We need to update the nav property to use motion. We also set variants that are using normal CSS classes, animate, and transition.

I gave the navbar some simple Tailwind CSS styling, but feel free to style it as you please.

```
<motion.nav
        variants={{
          visible: { y: 0 },
          hidden: { y: "-100%" },
        }}
        animate={navHidden ? "hidden" : "visible"}
        transition={{ duration: 0.4, ease: "easeInOut" }}
        className="fixed w-full bg-slate-300 p-10 flex justify-between items-center z-50"
      >
       
       {/* Your nav links goes here */}

      </motion.nav>
```

Add this:

```
const { scrollY } = useScroll();
  const [navHidden, setNavHidden] = useState(false);

  useMotionValueEvent(scrollY, "change", (latest) => {
    const previous = scrollY.getPrevious();

    if (previous != undefined && latest > previous && latest > 100) {
      setNavHidden(true);
    } else {
      setNavHidden(false);
    }
  });
```

And you're done.
